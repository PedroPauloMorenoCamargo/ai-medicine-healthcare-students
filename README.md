- **Run cells in order** (don't skip!)
- **Read error messages** carefully
- **Google is your friend** (StackOverflow, PyTorch docs)

### Learning Strategies
- **Type code yourself** (don't just copy-paste)
- **Experiment** (change values, see what happens)
- **Ask "why"** not just "how"
- **Connect to medicine** (think about real applications)

### Collaboration
- **Help each other** (teaching reinforces learning)
- **Share resources** (good tutorials, articles)
- **But write your own code** (academic integrity!)
- **Give credit** (cite sources, acknowledge help)

---

## 📋 Academic Integrity

All work must be your own or your group's. You may:
- ✅ Discuss concepts with classmates
- ✅ Search for help online (StackOverflow, documentation)
- ✅ Use AI assistants for understanding concepts
- ✅ Collaborate within your assigned group

You may NOT:
- ❌ Copy code from other groups
- ❌ Submit someone else's work as your own
- ❌ Share assignment solutions publicly
- ❌ Use solutions from previous years

**Violations result in:** Zero on assignment to course failure, depending on severity.
